 Set up automated discounts (for Shopify and WooCommerce merchants)

We’re launching a new beta feature for Shopify and WooCommerce merchants called automated discounts to help retailers effectively price their products with the goal of driving incremental profit.

Retailers in the feature’s beta release allow Google to help them discount their product prices based on multiple real-time signals. Merchants then apply this price on their website for Shopping ads traffic.


  Note: Merchants not using Shopify or WooCommerce follow a different process for setting up automated discounts. Learn how to Set up automated discounts.


Benefits

Automated discounts allow you to effectively price products in Shopping ads on Google. Our goal is to help you drive more conversions and profit.


  Customize pricing: Find the optimum product discount or promotion across Shopping ads and your site’s product landing pages with the help of Google’s high-scale models.
  Save time: Automated, real-time price optimization saves time, effort, and cost.


Eligibility and requirements

To participate in the beta, you need to have an aggregated minimum of 1,000 product clicks (per week) at the merchant-level.
