    Quick answers

    Do I need a certain level of access to delete my account? 
      Yes, an admin user will need to delete your Merchant Center account.

    If I delete my account, may I create a different account for my business?
      Yes, you may create a new Merchant Center account at any time.
  



  Keep in mind that deleting your Merchant Center account is different from removing your Merchant Center account access, canceling your Google Ads account, or deleting your Google Account.



Before you begin

When you delete your account, your access to all data and transactions will be disabled. So, before deleting your account:


  Download any product data, reports, or other assets you'd like to retain
  Process or cancel any active transactions


What happens when the account is deleted

When you delete your Merchant Center account, you’ll immediately lose all access to the account, your products will be disapproved, and your Shopping ads and free product listings will stop showing. Any other products you have linked to this account will no longer be linked.

All users on the account will be notified via email that the account has been deleted. All users will lose access to the account immediately. Shopping ads and other Merchant Center features will be deactivated within 48 hours.
