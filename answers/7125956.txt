  Attempts to revise history against the interests of a protected group
  The promotion of self-harm and violence against people or animals

Sensitive issues

Google Customer Reviews doesn't allow the promotion of products attempting to capitalize on sensitive issues. Sensitive issues are usually identified in response to exceptional global events that can't be predicted, like natural disasters or political uprisings, and therefore aren't outlined on this page.

Inappropriate language

Google Customer Reviews doesnâ€™t allow content or websites containing excessive inappropriate language or profanity. This also includes variations and misspellings of inappropriate language.
