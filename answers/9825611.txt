How it works

Just as we don't charge sites to be part of the Google Search index, if you’re a participating merchant, your products can appear in local product results across Google properties for free. To become eligible:


  Follow policies for listing your products for free on Google and policies for local inventory ads.
  Submit your primary feed and local product inventory feed through Google Merchant Center. Learn more
  Opt in to list your local products for free on Google by selecting the corresponding feature in Merchant Center. Learn more



  
    Note: For merchants submitting feeds through Google Merchant Center, this feature applies to showing your in-store product offers in free listings on Google. If you submit a feed through Google Merchant Center and don't opt into this feature, Google may still use and display certain product feed data you submit (for example, titles and images) as described in the Merchant Center terms of service, including to improve Google’s services.

    Also, if you’ve previously submitted a product feed to Google, you may already have products appearing in free listings. Follow these instructions to manage your destinations, if you don’t want your products appearing on free local listings.
