 Promotions feed specification

This article lists all of the attributes you can provide in your promotions feed.

To use promotions, you can submit your product data to Google through a feed. The information within your feed is then distributed on relevant Shopping ads as well as free product listings appearing on the Shopping tab in the US (may also appear outside of the US as well). Promotions will display for customers on desktop and mobile devices in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.


Submit a promotions feed

File type: You can use either an XML file, tab-delimited file, or Google Spreadsheet. View an example feed template

Registering and uploading a new feed: Follow the steps to register and upload a new promotions feed. Upload your promotions feed to the same Merchant Center account you use for your online products feed.


  Google reviews all promotions against program policies and editorial requirements before displaying them.



Create promotions to target specific products

You can create promotions for specific products in the following ways:


  Apply product filter attributes in your promotion feed: If a promotion applies to specific products in your product feed, you may use product filter attributes. View Product filters.
  Map the promotion ID to products in your product feed: For Google to recognize the products included in your promotion, submit a value for the promotion ID [promotion ID] attribute and map that to the eligible products in your products feed. For more information about mapping, view how to create promotion groups for specific products.


If you set product filters on the promotion feeds and explicit promotion IDs in the product feed, then the promotion applies to products selected by both applying product filter attributes and mapping the promotion ID to your products.


Basic promotions data

Include the following attributes in your feed to define how your promotions will display:



  
    
      Attribute
      Minimum requirements at a glance
    
  
  
    
      Promotion ID [promotion_id]
       Required

      Syntax

      
        Maximum length is 50 characters
        Case sensitive
        Should not contain spaces or symbols (such as % and !)
      
      
      
      This attribute is the unique ID of a promotion.

      The promotion ID [promotion_id] attribute is used to link promotions to specific products.
      
    
    
      
      Products eligible for promotion [product_applicability]

       Required

      Supported values

      
        All products
          [all_products]
        Specific products specific_products
      
      
      
      This attribute specifies if the promotion applies to all products or only to specific products.

      
        If the value is specific products specific_products, you must use product filter attributes or map a promotion ID [promotion_id] to applicable products in your products feed. These specific products are continuously tested for the duration of the promotion.
        If the value is all products [all_products], you do not need to use product filter attributes or a promotion ID [promotion_id] in the products feed. The promotion validity is tested against all of the items in your products feed.
      
      
    
    
      
      Coupon code required [offer_type]

       Required

      Supported values

      
        No code [no_code]
        Generic code [generic_code]
      

      If the value for this attribute is generic_code (that is, a code that is the same for all customers), the attribute below is required:

      
        Generic redemption code [generic_redemption_code]
      
      
      
      This attribute indicates whether or not a coupon code is required for customers to redeem the offer.

      Note: All shipping promotions must include a valid redemption code.

      
        Free shipping promotions must include a valid coupon code that customers can manually apply. Otherwise, shipping will be treated as a service that is normally offered.
      

      Learn more about how to include redemption codes for shipping promotions in the promotions program policies.
      
    
    
      Promotion title [long_title]
       Required

      Syntax

      
        Maximum length is 60 characters
      

      Example

      
        Free mug with purchase
      
      
      
      This attribute specifies the full title of the promotion.

      Important:

      Follow our editorial requirements closely. They outline title requirements and provide helpful examples of acceptable and unacceptable titles.

      The title should describe the promotion completely and accurately.
      
    
    
      Promotion start date [promotion_effective_dates]
       Required

      Syntax

      
        Start date and end date are separated by a forward slash (/).
        The date format is (YYYY-MM-DD), followed by the letter ‘T’, the time of day when the sale starts or ends, and an expression of the time zone for the sale.
      

      Example

      If your promotion is valid from 3:00 a.m. on July 19, 2009 to 9:00 p.m. on July 26, 2009 EST (Eastern Standard Time), you would submit:

      2009-07-19T03:00:00-05:00/2009-07-26T21:00:00-05:00

      If your promotion is valid from 3:00 a.m. on July 19, 2009 to 9:00 p.m. on July 26, 2009 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), you would submit:

      2009-07-19T03:00:00+00:00/2009-07-26T21:00:00+00:00
      
      
      Important:

      
        GMT is Greenwich Mean Time. -5 hours represents EST while -8 hours represents PST.
        Promotions have a 6-month limit (183 days).
        Daylight Savings: -4 hours represents EDT while -7 hours represents PDT.
      

      If you use the promotion builder, it will only support the promotion start date [promotion_effective_dates] attribute and the time will default to the time zone of your Merchant Center account setting. If you want the promotion to be in a different time zone, adjust the time zone manually.

      Tip: You can validate your promotion before it starts by using the promotion display dates [promotions_display_dates] attribute. Learn more about promotions feed formatting and attributes
      
    
    
      
      Eligible channel for promotion [redemption_channel]

       Required

      Promotion destination [promotion_destination]

       Required

      Supported values

      
        Shopping ads [Shopping_ads]
        Buy on Google listings [Buy_on_Google_listings]
        Free listings [Free_listings]
      

      Add a supported value to your feed. To submit your promotion to one or more destination, submit each destination value as a separate column:

      
        promotion_destination: local_inventory_ads
        promotion_destination: Shopping_ads
        promotion_destination: Buy_on_Google_listings
        promotion_destination: Free_listings
      

      Important:

      If you use the promotion destination [promotion_destination] attribute, and don't specify a destination by including a supported value in your feed, your promotion will display in Shopping ads and free listings by default.
      
      
      Important:

      These are repeated fields and values are supported simultaneously. Values indicated in this field will overwrite any product defaults.

      For more details on repeated fields, view About attributes with repeated fields.

      Note:

      The Buy on Google listings [Buy_on_Google_listings] destination is only applicable to advertisers enrolled in Buy on Google.

      The free listings [Free_listings] destination requires an approved offer for free listings. In addition, we recommend offers submitted via promotions feed be in structured format to help ensure faster approval.
      
    
  



  Note: Some of the names for product destinations have been updated. You may have previously submitted the following values as destinations for your products: Shopping Actions, Surfaces across Google, Local surfaces across Google. These values will still be accepted, but we recommend that you update your products to include the new values for these destinations: Buy_on_Google_listings, Free_listings, Free_local_listings.




Product filters

If you create a promotion that only applies to specific products in your product feed, use the product filter in your promotion feed. The product filter attributes only apply when the products eligible for promotion [product_applicability] attribute is set to specific_products. All the attributes under this section are repeated fields with a limit up to 1,000 in XML/CSV.

The product filter attributes in the table below determine the products that apply for a promotion. When the same attribute is used more than once, the product must match at least one of the attributes for the filter to apply. When there are multiple filters, only the products that pass all filters are selected for the promotion. If a filter excludes a product and another filter includes the same product, the product will be excluded from the promotion.

Example:

For example, if you create a promotion for brand = "example1" and product_type = “Tshirt”, the promotion will apply only to those products in the product feed that have brand =“example1” and product_type = “Tshirt”.

Alternatively, you can also link a product to a specific promotion by setting the promotion ID [promotion_id] attribute in the product feed.

Promotion details

The following sections describe the different attributes you can use to create structured promotions, such as “Buy N, get M”.


  "Preconditions" are used to set up the requirements that must be met for the customer to redeem the promotion
  "Promotion categories" determine the type of promotion
  "Limits" determine the restrictions you can apply to your promotions (for example, you can set a limit on the minimum price or quantity of eligible purchases required for a customer to receive a promotion)


Preconditions

This attribute communicates the precondition (a minimum purchase amount) that a customer needs to meet to redeem a promotion. It does not filter the products that are eligible for a promotion. To filter, use product filters.

For example, if you want to create:


  A “Free shipping with $50 purchase” promotion, set the minimum purchase amount [minimum_purchase_amount] attribute to 50 USD.
  A “Free tote bag with $100 purchase” promotion, set the minimum purchase amount [minimum_purchase_amount] attribute to 100 USD.
