 About the sales feed specification


  This feed is only used to implement the optional local feeds partnership program.



The sales feed provides a list of all products sold within a set time period. We recommend updating this feed at least daily. Upload at least 60 days worth of sales data in your first upload.

Each time you upload the sales feed, product information is updated incrementally. You only need to include products which have been sold since the previous feed update.


  Note: In order to implement the local feeds partnership program, you're required to upload either an inventory feed or a sales feed. You can also upload both feeds and use them in combination.
