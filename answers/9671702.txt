 How to fix: Business Profile not verified

One or more store code in your local inventory data is referencing a business that has been identified as not verified within the linked business group.

Fix your issue


  Step 1 of 3: View the affected store codes

  
    
      
        In your Merchant Center account, select Products on the navigation menu, then click Feeds.
        Click the name of your local product inventory feed.
        In the “Processing” tab, click Download file.
        Open the file and filter by error “Business Profile not verified.”

  Step 3 of 3: Resubmit your product data

  
    
      After claiming your business, resubmit your inventory feed using one of these methods:
        
          Upload a feed
          Submit through the Content API
        
      
      Check if you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the processing report.
    

    
      Note: It can take up to 24 hours to sync your business locations into your Merchant Center account, so we recommend that you upload your inventory feed 24 hours after linking accounts, or after a store code is updated in your Business Profile.
