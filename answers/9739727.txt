 How to fix: Incorrect value: Google product category [google_product_category]Submit a Google product category for books

One or more of your products has been detected to be a book, but has not been identified as such using the correct category for the Google product category [google_product_category] attribute. Either the Google product category [google_product_category] has not been set, or it has been set to the wrong category. As a result, the offer has been disapproved.

To fix this issue, set the value for the Google product category [google_product_category] attribute to Media > Books, Media > Books > Audiobooks, or Media > Books > Print Books.

It is possible that we may have mistakenly detected that your offer was a book. Check the offer title and description to help ensure your products are correctly categorized.

      Filter the downloaded report so that you only see products with:
        "Issue title" = Invalid value: Google product category [google_product_category]
      Search your product data for those products (using the ID), and make sure each product is using the Google product category [google_product_category] attribute, as well as the correct book-related value.
      If you believe your offer was mistakenly identified as a book, check the offer title and description. Certain identifying terms could incorrectly indicate that the product is a book. You can try removing or replacing these terms.

  Next, check that you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the Diagnostics page.
    
    Keep in mind: It may take some time for your change to be reflected on the Diagnostics page.
