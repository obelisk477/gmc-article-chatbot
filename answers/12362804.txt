 Get your products started with Shopping on YouTube

YouTube offers great opportunities to showcase your own products, be discovered and allow YouTube audiences to check out on your website, or directly on YouTube via Buy on Google, depending on which program your feed is opted into. There are several ways to show your products on YouTube, depending on which programs you participate in. 

Get your products onto YouTube

Your products that show in free listings may be eligible to appear across shopping experiences on Google, including on YouTube. See where Google shows your free product listings on YouTube

  Before setting up your feed on Buy on Google, make sure your store is connected to YouTube Shopping so that you see the YouTube Shopping program enabled for your feed.
  Once you've finished onboarding with YouTube Shopping, activate a Buy on Google account.
  Clicks for Buy on Google listings are counted within Buy on Google reporting in Merchant Center.
