Availability


  Note: While quantity [quantity] is optional, availability [availability] is mandatory for ads to run.


Availability [availability] must be submitted as a text string with 1 of 4 accepted values:


  "in stock"
  "out of stock"
  "limited availability"
  "on display to order"


If you decide to submit quantity [quantity], this is how you match your availability [availability]: if there are 3 or more available, the product is considered to be "in stock." If there are 1–2 available, the product is considered to have "limited availability." If there are 0 available, the item is considered to be "out of stock."
