Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your collections.


Minimum requirements

These are the requirements you need to meet to show your collection. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your collection and let you know in the Diagnostics page of your Merchant Center account.



  Use only one language for each collection. To include multiple languages, create multiple collections, each with a different language.Â 
  Always specify a language for collections that have featured products. This will allow us to determine specific products associated with your collection.



Best practices

These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your collection data for performance.



  Only link products with the same language as the language for your collection if your collection has featured products.
