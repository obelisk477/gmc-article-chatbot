Requirements

Choose shipping services with short transit times

10 days is the maximum transit time allowed in the settings.

However, we strongly recommend aiming for a lower transit time in accordance with your carrier contract as this can be a decisive purchase factor for users. Learn more about estimated delivery time

Handling time

4 days is the maximum handling time allowed in the settings.

We however strongly recommend having a shorter handling time. This time will be added to your overall shipping time and may represent a serious brake on your customers’ purchase decision.


  Orders that aren't shipped within 3 days of your handling time may be canceled automatically. For example, if you have a handling time of 2 days, and you don’t ship your orders within 5 days from when they are placed, they will be cancelled. Note that you are responsible for the cost of a product when a canceled product has been shipped to the customer. To ensure a good customer experience, make sure your handling times are accurate.


Tracking numbers

When you mark your products as shipped, you must provide a valid tracking number to the customer within 1 day of shipment. This number must provide end-to-end tracking, from the original handoff to the carrier until delivery to the customer.

Second line in shipping addresses

Your shipping settings will need to support a second addressee line - for information such as company names, building names, or hotel names. This is to prevent order cancellation due to too many characters in the recipient field.

Packaging recommendations

Follow these recommendations when packaging your orders:


  If the customer is not on your marketing list, don't provide marketing inserts in packages.


Packing slips

To ensure a positive customer experience, all packing slip information should include:


  Google order ID
  URL to access order details and initiate returns: shopping.google.com/orders
  Google Customer Service contact: support.google.com/googleshopping/contactflow


To avoid customer confusion or misinformation, less comprehensive packing slips should not include:


  Price information
  Return instructions that direct customers to contact the retailer
  Retailer customer support information


Note: If you are unable to update the above information on your packing slips, you can send shipments without including any packing slip at all, but this is not recommended.

Unsupported shipping options

The following shipping options are not supported with Buy on Google purchases:


  Additional shipping information or freight deliveries: Google can't collect information from customers regarding the need for scheduled deliveries, liftgates, white glove service, or other recipient-specific differentiation. Products that need to be shipped by freight are not supported.
  Dynamic shipping costs: Google can't support shipping costs that change dynamically based on the origin of the shipment, or costs that differ based on residential or commercial delivery addresses. Likewise, membership-based shipping pricing (for example, ShopRunner) is not supported.
  Curbside delivery: Google does not currently support the curbside delivery of products purchased through Buy on Google.
  Unsupported delivery destinations: Google does not currently support delivery to PO boxes, APO/FPO boxes, Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico.


Understanding estimated delivery date

Buy on Google Best Practices Episode 1: Calculating the estimated delivery date

For subtitles in your language, turn on YouTube captions. Select the settings icon  at the bottom of the video player, then select "Subtitles/CC" and choose your language.




Estimated delivery date is the “arrives by” date that customers are shown when checking out. This value is calculated as “maximum handling days + maximum transit days.” Estimated delivery date is calculated using days, and also takes order cutoff time into account.

Here is an example of what estimated delivery date might look like with the settings below in Merchant Center:

Order placed after the cut-off of 3 p.m. EST

0 - 1 handling days

3 - 5 transit days


  
    
      
      Minimum estimated delivery date: 7 calendar days
      
      Maximum estimated delivery date: 9 calendar days

  If a customer places an order at 8 p.m. EST on Wednesday, at checkout, they’ll see “arrives by the following Friday.” Since the customer missed the daily order cutoff, the delivery estimate doesn’t begin calculating until the following day. Then, Buy on Google uses the maximum handling and delivery range to calculate the arrival date (not including weekends or holidays). Keep in mind that while the Merchant Center will show you a range of delivery days, the customer will see the nine-day estimate to account for any potential issues that arise during processing and shipping.
