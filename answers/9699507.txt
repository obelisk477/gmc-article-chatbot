 About collections

Collections help you create rich ad and free product listing experiences in a simpler way. They can also enrich your product data, which may increase performance and improve the user experience.


Benefits


  Collections allow you to associate products and other creative assets with one another. You can combine images, videos, and text to create richer experiences for your customers.



How it works

A collection represents a group of products. A collection is defined once, but can be used in multiple ways. Each collection can include up to 100 products.


  Note: At this time collections are only used by promotion of local products within Performance Max for store goals.
