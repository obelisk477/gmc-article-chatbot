Basic promotions data

Include the following attributes in your feed to define how your promotions will display on the Shopping tab:


  
    
      Attribute
      Format
      Minimum requirements at a glance
    
  
  
    
      Promotion ID [promotion_id]
      
      Required

      Syntax

      
        Maximum length is 60 characters
        Case sensitive
        Should not contain spaces or symbols (such as % and !)
      
      
      
      
        This attribute is the unique ID of a promotion.
        The promotion ID is used to link promotions to specific products.
      
      
    
    
      Products eligible for promotion [product_applicability]
      
      Required

      Supported values

      
        all_product
        specific_products
      
      
      
      
        This attribute specifies if the promotion applies to all products or only to specific products.
        If the value is specific_products, you must use product filter attributes or map a promotion ID to applicable products in your products feed. These specific products are continuously tested for the duration of the promotion.
        If the value is all_products, you do not need to use product filter attributes or a promotion ID in the products feed. The promotion validity is tested against all of the items in your products feed.
      
      
    
    
      Promotion title [long_title]
      
      Required

      Syntax

      
        Maximum length is 60 characters
      

      Example

      
        Free mug with purchase
      
      
      
      This attribute specifies the full title of the promotion.

      Editorial requirements outline title requirements and provide helpful examples of acceptable and unacceptable titles.

      The title should describe the promotion completely and accurately.
      
    
    
      Promotion start date [promotion_effective_dates]
      
      Required

      Syntax

      
        Start date and end date are separated by a forward slash (/).
        The date format is (YYYY-MM-DD), followed by the letter ‘T’, the time of day when the sale starts or ends, and an expression of the time zone for the sale.
      

      Example

      If your promotion was valid from 3:00 a.m. on July 19, 2009 to 9:00 p.m. on July 26, 2009 EST (Eastern Standard Time), you would submit:

      2009-07-19T03:00:00-05:00/2009-07-26T21:00:00-05:00

      If your promotion was valid from 3:00 a.m. on July 19, 2009 to 9:00 p.m. on July 26, 2009 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), you would submit:

      2009-07-19T03:00:00+00:00/2009-07-26T21:00:00+00:00
      
      
      Important:

      
        GMT is Greenwich Mean Time. -5 hours represents EST while -8 hours represents PST.
        Promotions have a 6-month limit (183 days).
        Daylight Savings: -4 hours represents EDT while -7 hours represents PDT.
      

      If you use the promotion builder, it will only support the promotion start date attribute and the time will default to the time zone of your Merchant Center account setting. If you want the promotion to be in a different time zone, adjust the time zone manually.

      Tip: You can validate your promotion before it starts by using the display dates for promotion [promotion_display_dates] attribute. Learn more about promotions feed formatting and attributes
      
    
    
      Online eligibility for promotion [redemption_channel]
      
      Required

      Supported values

      
        Online
      
      
      This attribute indicates the promotion is valid online.
    
    
      Promotion destination [promotion_destination]

        Shopping_ads
        Buy_on_Google_listings

        promotion_destination: Shopping ads
        promotion_destination: Buy on Google listings
        promotion_destination: Free listings
      

      Important:

      If you use the promotion destination attribute, and don't specify a destination by including a supported value in your feed, your promotion will display in Shopping ads and free listings by default.
      
      
      Important:

      These are repeated fields and both values are supported simultaneously. Values indicated in this field will overwrite any product defaults.

      For more details on repeated fields, see About attributes with repeated fields.

      Note:

      The value Free_listings is only available in the US, and requires an approved offer for free listings. In addition, we recommend offers submitted via promotions feed be in structured format to help ensure faster approval.
      
    
    
      Maximum number of promotion destinations [end_promo_max_applies]
      
      Optional

      Must be an integer

      Example

      10
      
      The maximum number of orders a promotion can be applied to.
    
    
      Maximum budget for promotion [end_promo_max_cost]

      Must be a number and include currency

      Example

      20.00 USD
      
      The maximum budget amount set for a promotion.
    
  



  Note: Some of the names for product destinations have been updated. You may have previously submitted the following values as destinations for your products: Shopping Actions, Surfaces across Google, Local surfaces across Google. These values will still be accepted, but we recommend that you update your products to include the new values for these destinations: Buy_on_Google_listings, Free_listings, Free_local_listings.



Create promotions for specific products

You can create promotions for specific products to promote on Buy on Google in the following ways:


  Apply product filter attributes in promotion feed: If a promotion applies to specific products in your product feed, you may use product filter attributes. See Product filters.
  Map the promotion ID to your products: For Google to recognize the products included in your promotion, map a promotion ID [promotion_id] to the eligible products in your products feed.


If you set product filters on the promotion feeds and explicit promotion IDs in the product feed, then the promotion applies to products selected by both applying product filter attributes and mapping the promotion ID to your products.

Product filters

If you create a promotion that only applies to specific products in your product feed for Buy on Google, use the product filter in your promotion feed. The product filter attributes only apply when the products eligible for promotion [product_applicability] attribute is set to specific_products. All the product filter attributes are repeated fields with a limit of up to 1,000 values in an XML/CSV file.

The product filter attributes in the table below determine the products that a promotion will apply to. When the same attribute is used more than once, the product must match at least one of the attributes for the filter to apply. When there are multiple filters, only the products that pass all filters are selected for the promotion. If a filter excludes a product and another filter includes the same product, the product will be excluded from the promotion.

For example, if you create a promotion for brand = “example1'” and product_type = “Tshirt”, the promotion will apply only to those products in the product feed that have brand =“example1” and product_type = “Tshirt”.

Alternatively, you can also link a product to a specific promotion by setting the promotion ID [promotion_id] in the product feed.

Promotion details

The following sections describe the different attributes you can use to create structured promotions on Buy on Google, such as “Buy N, get M”.
