 How to fix: Store not under linked Business ProfileRemove stores outside linked Business Profile from the offer

One or more store codes in your vehicle inventory ads data (which are submitted using the vehicle fulfillment store code [vehicle_fulfillment_store_code] or store code [store_code] attributes) could not be found in the Business Profile location group linked to your Google Merchant Center account. However, the relevant store codes were matched with store codes in another location group associated with the linked Business Profile account(s). As a result, the offers associated with those store codes are not eligible to be shown in ads.


  Note: Please verify the business listings with the identified store codes carefully to ensure that these are associated with the business listings you intend to utilize for your vehicle listings. The store code that matched to business listings in another location group in your Business Profile account could be the result of a formatting error or due to matching with an identical store code that is associated with an unrelated business listing.


Please review all other location groups associated with your Business Profile account to identify the affected store codes. Ensure that the store codes are indeed connected to the correct business listings. If they are, then transfer these listings to the location group linked to your Google Merchant Center account.
