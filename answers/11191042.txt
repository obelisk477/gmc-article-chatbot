 High Fat Sugar Salt Food and Beverage


  This policy applies to Shopping ads and local inventory ads



Our policy


  
    
      
        
        We support responsible advertising of food and beverages. High Fat Sugar Salt (HFSS) Food & Beverage (F&B) Shopping ads are allowed if they comply with our policies. We consider ads to be promoting the sale of HFSS products when one or more HFSS food item, beverage, or meal is promoted in the ad (text, imagery, audio and/or video) or destination site. Specifically, Shopping ads that contain HFSS foods and beverages are now prohibited from targeting minors.

        The information reflected in this policy is not intended to be legal advice and we expect all merchants and partners to comply with the local laws for any region their ads target, including local requirements that may differ from this HFSS Food & Beverage policy.
        
      
    
  


Below are some examples of F&B products (non-exhaustive) that are considered HFSS. Shopping ads that contain nutritional information indicating the products are within the allowed threshold for FSS and serving size/calories, or on successful appeal by the merchant, may be eligible to serve. For the complete nutritional thresholds for HFSS F&B products, please see the table below.

Google HFSS F&B Nutritional Profile

  Nutrient levels are applied on a 100-gram and per serving basis for global applicability and to reflect common labeled serving sizes and calorie levels for meal and meal components. If the serving size of your advertised food or beverage does not closely match the listed serving size (LSS), please evaluate your product using the per 100-gram criteria.
