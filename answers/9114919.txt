 Manage orders in bulk using order feeds 

To manage significant order volume without needing to use the Orders API or manually manage orders in Merchant Center, use order feeds to receive, process, and update orders. Order feeds allow you to make bulk changes to your new and existing orders, including:


  Mark an ordered product as shipped
  Bulk upload tracking information for products that you’ve shipped
  Cancel an order or individual product from an order


This article explains how to make changes to your order statuses using order feeds.

Before you begin


  Familiarize yourself with the Order feeds formatting
  Make sure to use either the .csv or .tsv file type for your order feeds


Download your order feed


  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.
  From the navigation panel, click Orders.
  Select the List tab.
  From anywhere your orders are available (for example, from the “Pending shipment” section), click the Download button.



  The order feed download will include your customers’ marketing opt-in information, which is also available using Google’s Orders API.


Upload your order feed


  From the navigation panel, click Orders.
  Select the Import tab.
  Select Upload input file.
  Drag and drop or select your feed file.
  (Optional) If you’d like to apply testing or "sandbox" mode, check the box.
  Click Upload.



  
    About test mode for order feeds

    When uploading your order feed, you’ll have the option to use the testing, or "sandbox" mode. This allows you to test your order feed integration without impacting user orders.
