Our policy


  
    
      
        
        
          Google restricts the listing of healthcare-related content such as the following:

          
            Over-the-counter medication
            Prescription drugs
            Unapproved pharmaceuticals and supplements
            Pregnancy and fertility-related products
          

          The restrictions that apply to this content may vary depending on the product you're listing and the countries that you're targeting. Some content, such as unapproved supplements, may not be listed anywhere.

          Depending on the content you’re listing and the countries where your ads appear, you may need to apply for preauthorization with Google before advertising healthcare-related content.
        
        
      
    
  


Examples of what's allowed in some circumstances

Here are some of the kinds of content that we restrict under this policy:


  
    
      
        
        Prescription and behind-the-counter drugs
        
      
    
  



  
  
    Google allows the listing of prescription and behind-the-counter drugs in the United States. In Canada, retailers are allowed to list prescription drugs. Online pharmacies listing prescription drugs must be accredited by the LegitScript Healthcare Merchant Certification and Monitoring Program or the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy’s (NABP) VIPPS program or .pharmacy Verified Websites Program, and certified by Google. If you have already been certified by LegitScript or the NABP, apply for certification with Google by filling out our online pharmacy application form. See a non-exhaustive list of prescription drugs or active ingredients that are monitored under this policy. The promotion of prescription opioid painkillers is not allowed, per the policy below.
  
  



  
    
      
        
        Over-the-counter medication
        
      
    
  



  
  In some countries listed below, only online pharmacies may list over-the-counter medication products, provided that certification is available for the country involved and they meet the associated certification requirements. In the United States, no certification is required for the listing of over-the-counter medication. In other countries, if no certification process is available for a country, these products can’t be listed.

What you can do

Here's what you can do if your product is disapproved or if your Merchant Center account is impacted:


Product disapproval

  Products that don't comply with our policies may be disapproved. When a product is disapproved, it won't be eligible to serve. 

  
    Read our policies to learn what we don't allow.
    Update your website. If your ad or listing leads to content that violates a policy, update your website to meet the requirements and be in compliance with our policies.
    Remove the violating products from your product data. You’ll receive an email with details about the violation. 
      
        If you have products in your product data that violate the policy (or policies), you'll need to remove the offers from your feed.
      
    
    Update your product data in Merchant Center. If you created a schedule for automatic uploads, update your product data manually or wait for your product data to be automatically updated before requesting any reviews.
    Request a review of your products or appeal the decision taken on this issue.
      
        If the violating products are removed, you won't need to request a review or take any additional action.
        If you fix your product-level issues by editing your product data via your chosen upload method (such as a file) or directly in Merchant Center, your products will be re-reviewed.
        For certain issues, you can disagree with the issue but you may need to complete additional steps such as provide an appeal reason and/or upload required documentation.
        If you use a third-party platform to list your products, you can refer to your third-party if you want to request a review. You won’t be able to do this in Merchant Center.
        If a review or appeal is successful, the issue will disappear from Merchant Center.
      
    
  



Account disapproval

  For most violations, we'll send you a warning email detailing the policy violation and give you 7 or 28 calendar days to fix your issue.

  
    Read our policies to learn what we don't allow.

        If your account is still within the warning period, it will automatically be reviewed again at the end of the warning period. If the violating products are removed, you won't need to request an account review or take any additional action.
        If your account is suspended and you've taken actions to resolve the issue, request an account review.
        For certain issues, you can disagree with the issue but you may need to complete additional steps such as provide an appeal reason and/or upload required documentation.

  Most accounts are reviewed within 3 business days, but it can take longer if a more complex review is needed. If we find that you've removed the violating products from your product data, we’ll remove the warning. If a review or appeal is successful, the issue will disappear from Merchant Center. In the case of account suspension, we'll then also approve your account so your products can start displaying again.
