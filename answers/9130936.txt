 Order feed specification

This article explains the data specifications you’ll need to follow to upload order feeds in Merchant Center.

About order feed formatting


  Order feeds contain actions that represent order status changes. For example, shipping or cancelling an order.
  Create your feed in a delimited format where the first row contains the attribute name of each column. Each line after must define an action performed on one particular line item of an order.
  Use English for the name of the attribute and supported attributes values. For example, the action [action] attribute may have the supported value “shipped”. We recommend using the language of the target country for any attribute value without a supported value, for example, cancellation reason text [cancellation_reason_text].
  Use an underscore within an attribute name. For example: cancellation_reason.
