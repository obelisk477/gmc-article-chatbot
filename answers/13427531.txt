About free listings

Free listings allow customers to see product results from your Shopify store across Google, such as on the Shopping tab, YouTube, Google Search (.com), Google Images, and Google Lens.

Customers who search on the Shopping tab have a high purchase intent, so your product listings in those search results might convert better than regular search engine results. Additionally, only approved products appear in Shopping tab search results, so there is a greater chance that new customers will discover your products when searching with the Shopping tab than within regular search engine listings. Your products might also appear as a rich snippet in the Search results page for related product searches.


  
    Note: Your products aren't guaranteed to show across Google, as we rely on the data that you provide to us to then match what customers might be searching for.

To improve the performance of your product listings on the Shopping tab, use the following guidance to help you optimize your product information:


  Make sure that your product and store information is descriptive and up to date.
  Add high-quality images to your products.
  Optimize your product titles and descriptions by including keywords that customers use in searches.
  Add relevant product data, such as size or gender, to improve the chance that customers can find your products.
  Add a product type to your products up to at least 3 levels. Learn more about Product type.



  
    Note: If you're new to online selling, then it might take time before your products appear in relevant search results.

Confirm that your product feed is opted in to surfaces across Google

For your synced products to be eligible to show in free listings across Google, your store needs to sell in a supported country or region. Additionally, the method that you used to create your Merchant Center account determines whether your product feed is automatically opted in to show on surfaces across Google:


  If you created your Merchant Center account by using the Google & YouTube app on Shopify and your store meets eligibility requirements, then your approved products can automatically start appearing on the Shopping tab in relevant search results.
  If you created your Merchant Center account outside of Shopify, then you need to use Merchant Center to confirm whether your products can appear on the Shopping tab in relevant search results.
