 Fix issues with disapproved promotions

This article describes common policy and validation review disapprovals, troubleshooting steps, and tips to avoid future disapprovals.

To understand how Google reviews and validates your promotions, view the promotion approval process.

  Your shipping promotion wasn’t associated with a redemption code.

  Possible causes:

  There's no redemption code associated with the specific promotion.

  How to troubleshoot:

  
    Add a valid coupon code in your promotion’s details.
    Test the code to make sure free or discounted shipping is only available after the code is applied.

    Resubmit your promotion.

Inconsistent applicability


  What this disapproval means:

  The product applicability is inconsistent with the promotion’s title.

  Possible causes:

  
    Your promotion’s long title describes a promotion that's applicable to all products (for example: promotion’s long title is “10% off storewide”); however, the products eligible for promotion [product applicability] attribute is set to specific_products
    Your promotion’s long title describes a promotion that's only applicable to a subset of products on your website (for example: promotion’s long title is “10% off women’s shoes”); however, the product applicability is set to all_products.
  

  How to troubleshoot:

  
    Edit your applicability to match the promotion’s title.
    Resubmit your promotion.
  

  Tip to avoid future disapprovals:

  
    Ensure the product applicability matches the promotion applicability as described in the long title
  


Minimum discount not stated


  What this disapproval means:

  Your promotion's long title doesn’t describe a minimum discount or benefit.

  Possible causes:

  
    Your promotion's long title only describes the maximum discount the customer can receive
      
        Not allowed: Get Up To 50% Off
        Allowed: Get 20–50% Off
      
    
    Your promotion's long title doesn’t describe any discount or benefit in the title
  

  How to troubleshoot:

  
    Revise your promotion's long title to describe the minimum discount the promotion offers.
    Resubmit your promotion.
  

  Tip to avoid future disapprovals:

  
    Before you submit a promotion, ensure that the title is clear, accurate, and states a minimum discount. For more information, refer to our participation criteria and policies.
  


Unclear free gift

What this disapproval means:

  Your title doesn’t clearly describe the free gift.

  Possible causes:

  Your promotion’s long title states “free gift” and doesn’t clearly describe the free gift being offered.

  
    Allowed:

      
        Free silk scarf with any purchase
        Free 7-piece tool kit (worth $300 USD) with any $500 USD purchase
        Free $75 USD necklace when you spend $200+ USD
      
    
    Not allowed:
      
        Free gift with $100+ USD purchase
        Surprise gift with any purchase
        Free item, redeem at checkout
      
    
  

  How to troubleshoot:

  
    Include a description of the free gift in the title.
    Resubmit your promotion.
  

  Note: Free gifts, gift cards, or e-cards must be reflected at the cart or checkout page. Feel free to view our Promotions policy page for more information.

    Ensure that the free gift is fully described in your long title before you submit a promotion
  





Common product validation review disapprovals

Unmapped


  What this disapproval means:

  Your promotion could not be tested for any products.

  Possible causes:

  
    The submitted promotion does not map to any products in the products feed
    The promotion ID [promotion_id] attribute is space and case sensitive and may not have been entered exactly as created in the promotions feed, or with promotion builder
    Feed rules are set up incorrectly for the promotion ID [promotion_id] attribute for your products feed
    Eligible items are disapproved per Shopping ads policies
    Your promotion is set to a locale that has no products
  

  Note: If you’re using Shopify or Bigcommerce to upload products, these platforms cannot add attributes to the products feed.

  How to troubleshoot:

  
    Change the existing rules for applicable promotion products in promotion builder, or update your product filter in your promotions feed.
    Resubmit your promotion.
  


Free shipping available without code


  What this disapproval means:

  The free or discounted shipping that you’re offering is already available without applying the redemption code.

  Possible causes:

  
    Free shipping was automatically applied at checkout on your website
    Free/discounted shipping is regularly offered on your website
  

  How to troubleshoot:

  
    Make the necessary changes to your website so free or discounted shipping is available only after customers manually enter in a redemption code.
    Request a retest by finding the promotion in your Promotions dashboard and clicking the speech bubble icon  in the "Status" column then selecting Request a retest.
  


Invalid coupon code


  What this disapproval means:

  When testing the promotion, the redemption code returned an error or didn't provide the described discount.

  Possible causes:

  
    The code is incorrect
    Your website isn’t correctly set up to apply the code
    The code did not provide the described discount at the cart or checkout page
    The products should not be tied to the promotion
  

  How to troubleshoot:

  
    Check to see that the redemption code is correct.
    If correct, ensure that it works on the website.
    If incorrect, create a new promotion ID [promotion_id] with the correct details.
    Ensure the promotion is associated with eligible items and remap the promotion ID [promotion_id] if necessary.
    Request a retest by finding the promotion in your Promotions dashboard and clicking the speech bubble icon  in the “Status” column, then selecting Request a retest. If this option does not appear, update and resubmit your promotion.
  

  Tip to avoid future disapprovals:

  
    Verify that the redemption code you submit is spelled exactly as it will be used on your website
  


No or lower discount


  What this disapproval means:

  At the cart/checkout page, there was no discount or a lower discount than the promotion’s title states.

  Possible causes:

  
    The sale price is already displayed on the product landing page and your Shopping ad or free product listing, which doesn’t benefit customers (they’re already getting the discounted price)
    The discount at the cart/checkout page is lower than the discount reflected in the title
  

  How to troubleshoot:

  
    Make the necessary changes to your website so that the discounted price stated in the title is only reflected at the cart or checkout page.
    Update and resubmit your promotion.
