How it works

Use the ISO 8601 standard, which this article explains in more detail. Depending on the attribute, you’ll submit a date or date range, and you can include a specific time.


Format a date

Include the date in the following format:


  YYYY-MM-DD


For example, to submit May 11, 2017, use:


  2017-05-11



Include a time

To add a specific time to your date:


  Follow the date with the letter T
  Add the time of day in 24-hour format: hh:mm:ss. For example: 13:00:14
  After the time, add the time zone. For example, for UTC-8, use: -0800


For example, to submit May 11, 2017 at 12:01:59 AM for the UTC-8 time zone, use:


  2017-05-11T00:01:59-0800


If you don’t include a time, we’ll use the end of the day: 23:59:59

If you don’t include a time zone, we’ll use a default time zone:


  Text and XML feeds will use the default time zone for your target country.
  The API will use UTC.

      -0800
    
  


Format date ranges

Some attributes accept date ranges that include a start and end date. A date range is a start date and end date separated with a slash ( / ): start/end

For example:


  2017-05-11T00:01:59-0800/2017-06-21T22:13:59-0800 for PST
  2017-02-24T11:07:31+0100 for Central European Time


If you don’t include a time, the start date will use 00:00:00, and the end date will use 23:59:59.
