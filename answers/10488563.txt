 About automatic website verification

Merchant Center is able to automatically verify and claim some retailer websites during the account setup process.

How it works

If Google already has the information it needs to verify your site (for example, if you use Google Analytics on your site), you’ll see a notification letting you know that your website has been automatically verified after you enter your site’s address on the “Business information” page.

In some cases, you’ll also receive an email from Search Console, a Google tool, letting you know that Merchant Center has created an account for you. Merchant Center verifies your site through Search Console.


  You can log in to Search Console anytime to review your account’s verification settings and users, or to explore its Google Search optimization and performance tools.


Troubleshooting

If automatic verification fails at any point, you’ll see a notification in the UI inviting you to verify and claim manually. Learn how to verify and claim your store’s website
