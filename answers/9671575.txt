 How to fix: Closed Business Profile

One or more store codes in your local inventory feed reference a Business Profile that has been marked as closed. Within your Business Profile Manager, go to the business group linked to your Merchant Center account and identify the store codes indicated as "Closed businesses" in the "Processing" tab of your local inventory feed.

Fix your issue


  Step 1 of 3: View the affected store codes

  
    
      
        In your Merchant Center account, select Products on the navigation menu, then click Feeds.
        Click the name of your local product inventory feed.
        In the “Processing” tab, click Download file.
        Open the file and filter by error “Closed Business Profile.”
      
    
  



  Step 2 of 3: Investigate the closed stores

  
    
      
        In your Business Profile Manager, go to “Businesses.”
        Filter for closed businesses at the top by switching the view from "All" to "Permanently closed" or "Temporarily closed."
        Verify if the inventory data for these locations was submitted correctly and that you intend to send inventory data for these stores.
        If those stores are open, you can reopen them by following the instructions here.
      
    
  



  Step 3 of 3: Resubmit your product data

  
    
      
        After claiming your business, resubmit your inventory feed using one of these methods:
          
            Upload a feed
            Submit through the Content API
          
        
        Next, check if you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the processing report.
      

      
        Note: It can take up to 24 hours to sync your business locations into your Merchant Center account, so we recommend that you upload your inventory feed 24 hours after linking accounts, or after a store code is updated in your Business Profile.
