 About Feed Tool partners

This article provides details on Feed Tool partners in the LIA Partner Program.

Feed Tool partners assist in developing product and inventory feeds for ads through expert guidance and feed management.

These partners are a resource for retailers who would like to begin using local inventory ads but are unable to provide their own product and inventory feeds or unable to meet the technical requirements on their own.
