 How to fix: Suspended Business Profile

One or more store code in your local inventory data is referencing a Business Profile that has been identified as suspended within the linked business group.

Fix your issue


  Step 1 of 2: Investigate the suspended Business Profile

  
    
      
        Ensure your Business Profile follows the Business Profile guidelines.
        Request a Business Profile reinstatement.
      
    
  



  Step 2 of 2: Resubmit your product data

  
    
      
        After your account has been reinstated, resubmit your inventory feed using one of these methods:
          
            Upload a feed
            Submit through the Content API
          
        
        Next, check if you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the processing report.
      

      
        Note: It can take up to 24 hours to sync your business locations into your Merchant Center account, so we recommend that you upload your inventory feed 24 hours after linking accounts, or after a store code is updated in your Business Profile.
