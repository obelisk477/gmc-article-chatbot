Instructions

Step 1: Add product data to your Merchant or Manufacturer Center feeds


  Google uses information from a variety of sources to display the best descriptions, imagery, and product details, and provide a unified and optimized product offering experience to the customer. This means we may not use the data you provide for some product listings.



  Manufacturers and brand owners

  
    If you’re a manufacturer or brand owner, you can sign up for Google Manufacturer Center. Manufacturer Center account allows manufacturers and brands to submit authoritative product data and can be used to power commercial results across Google.

    As a manufacturer or brand, Google trusts the data you share via Google Manufacturer Center to be the most accurate representation of a product. Google uses this information to help shoppers find and understand your products and to enrich the PDPs for your products.

    You can share the following product data attributes in your Manufacturer Center feeds:

Step 2: Share your Product Ratings


  This feature is only available in the classic Merchant Center experience.


Google Product Ratings gives retailers the ability to share and surface product ratings and product reviews.

If you participate in the Product Ratings program, you can share review data using a Google Product Ratings feed. Learn more about Product rating basics. The attributes listed below may help you to create a rich product ratings feed, and will help us match your reviews to your PDPs:


  
    
      Product data
      Product Ratings feed attribute
      Note
    
  
  
    
      Product rating
      <ratings>
      Required for all reviews
    
    
      Review content
      <content>
      Required for all reviews
    
    
      Review URL
      <review_url>
      Required for all reviews
    
    
      Product URL
      <product_url>
      Required for all reviews
    
    
      
      Product IDs
      
      <gtins>
      The reviews data from a Product Ratings feed is matched to products based on a number of factors, the strongest being globally unique product identifiers such as GTINs. (Without GTIN [gtin] data, Google will attempt to match a review through other information such as SKU or brand [brand] + MPN [mpn] pairs.)
    
    
      <mpns>
    
    
      <skus>
    
    
      <brands>
    
    
      Reviewer images
      <reviewer_images>
      We recommend that you include reviewer images when available.
    
    
      Verified purchases
      <collection_method>
      We recommend that you indicate whether a review was post purchase (verified) or unsolicited.
