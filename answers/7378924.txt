  How to use

  
    Once you join Buy on Google, all of the products in your existing product feed will be opted in by default. Any existing feeds in Merchant Center will automatically be opted in. If your account doesn't have any, you'll need to create a feed.

    You can reference our example file (.xlsx), which lists required and recommended attributes for Buy on Google, as you're creating your feed.

    
      Note: We're not able to process files in the .xls format. The .xls example file is for illustration purposes in a spreadsheet program.
    

    You need to exclude any individual products from your product feeds that you don't want included in Buy on Google or are ineligible for Buy on Google. For information about prohibited items, review the Terms of Service in your Merchant Center account, the Shopping ads policies, Buy on Google content policies, and Google payments center content policies.

    To exclude specific offers in your feed, use the excluded destination [excluded_destination] attribute and set the value to Buy_on_Google_listings

Returns


  
    
      Attribute
      Format
      Minimum requirements at a glance
    
    
      Return address label [return_address_label]
      Optional Specify the identifier of a specific return address for certain products Example my label Syntax Max 100 characters
      If you only have one return address (the default address), you do not need to make any updates to your feed. If you create multiple return addresses, you will need to add the return address label column to your feed. If the default address applies, keep this column blank. If a non-default return address applies, add the label name for that address.
    
    
      Return policy label [return_policy_label]
      
      Optional Apply a non-standard return policy for specific products. Example my label Syntax Max 100 characters
      
      Use this attribute if your product has a non-standard return policy. If no value is provided your default configured return policy will be applied.
    
    
      Return rule label [return_rule_label]
      
      Optional

      Apply a non-standard return rule for specific products.

      Example Needs oversized freight returns

      Syntax Max 100 characters
      
      
      If you need multiple return rules, you will need to add the return rule label column to your feed. You can create return rules, including the label for the return rule label, in the Merchant Center under “Settings,” then “Shipping and returns”. If a product has both returnless refunds and special return processing, then returnless refunds will take priority.

      Note: Once you migrate to the new way to configure return rules, you'll create a new rule by specifying a price condition instead of creating a return_rule_label.
      
    
  


Shipping

These attributes can be used together with the account shipping settings to help you provide accurate shipping information. Users rely on the shipping costs to help make choices about what to buy, so it's important to take the time to submit quality shipping information.
