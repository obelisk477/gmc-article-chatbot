 Post-purchase experience for shipping

To improve your post purchase experience and provide the option for customers to track their orders directly in Gmail with tracking updates, we encourage you to provide the following information in your order and/or shipment confirmation emails:


  Order number
  Product name and product image (if applicable) 
  Merchant name
  Order URL
  Tracking number 
  Estimated delivery date



  Note: This is currently only available for US orders and customers must opt-in to receiving these updates. Orders must be fulfilled through a supported carrier and data can also be provided via the Order and ParcelDelivery Schema.org.
