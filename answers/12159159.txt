 About adding a business name


  
    If you’re looking for information about store name guidelines in the classic Merchant Center experience, click here. 
  



When setting up your account, you'll add the name of your business. Customers will find this store name in your ads and free product listings.

To make sure that your business name works correctly in all situations, follow these guidelines:



  Enter a short name that represents your business name. You could use your business name or the name of your website. If your business name is too long, then we'll show your website URL instead.
  Don't include additional text or suffixes. For example, don't include "Inc.," "Co.," or "GmbH."
  Don't include promotional text. For example, don't include phone numbers, marketing messages, sale announcements.
  Don't use repeated and unnecessary punctuation, capitalization, or symbols. For example, don't spell your business name with emoticons, ALL CAPS, emoji, copyright symbols (©), or trademark symbols (™).
  Don’t include any personally identifiable information (PII). For example, don’t include full names or email addresses of individuals.
  Don't use offensive or inappropriate language.
  Use clear and professional language. If you make changes to your business name, they'll show up the next time you submit your product data.




  
    Keep in mind

    If your business name contains any errors or doesn't comply with our editorial and professional requirements, we may show your online store URL instead. You'll also find a notification about this in Merchant Center.
