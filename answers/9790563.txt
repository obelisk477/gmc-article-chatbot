 How to fix: Missing store code

The store code that you submitted in your local product inventory feed is blank. Your submitted store code must match one of the store's existing codes you have provided in your Business Profile. Ensure that your feed contains accurate store codes in all cases.

Fix your issue


  Step 1 of 3: View the affected inventory

  
    
      
        In your Merchant Center account, select Products on the navigation menu, then click Feeds.
        Click the name of your local product inventory feed.
        In the “Processing” tab, click Download file.
        Open the file and filter by error “Missing store code.”
      
    
  



  Step 2 of 3: Add the store codes to the inventory feed

  
    
      
        Identify which store the inventory belongs to.
        Add the existing store code provided in your Business Profile to the matching inventory.
      
    
  



  Step 3 of 3: Resubmit your product data

  
    
      
        After adding the store codes, resubmit your inventory feed using one of these methods:
          
            Upload a feed
            Submit through the Content API
          
        
        Next, check if you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the processing report.
      

      
        Note: It can take up to 24 hours to sync your business locations into your Merchant Center account, so we recommend that you upload your inventory feed 24 hours after linking accounts, or after a store code is updated in your Business Profile.
