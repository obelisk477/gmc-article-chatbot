 How to fix: Missing value: cutoff time

Some of the values entered in Merchant Center for the estimated cutoff time of a shipping service are missing.

Cut-off times specify the time up until which orders will be accepted and still be guaranteed to be processed on the current working day.

For example, a cut-off time of 3:00 pm EST means that orders placed after that time will not start being processed until the next business day, regardless of the time zone of the customer making the order.

Instructions


  Step 1: Check and correct values for shipping services

  
    
      Sign in to your Merchant Center account.
      Click the tools icon , then select Shipping and returns under “Tools”.
      To view and edit the details of the service, including cut-off time, find the “Service name” column under the Shipping services tab, then click the service name you want to edit. This will open the “Edit shipping service” form.
      To update the cut-off time, scroll to the “Delivery time” section and enter your default order cutoff time and timezone for this service.
    
  



  Step 2: Verify your changes

  
    Check that you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the Diagnostics page.

    Keep in mind: It may take some time for your change to be reflected on the Diagnostics page.
