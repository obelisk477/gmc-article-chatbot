 Availability for inventory

Your inventory availability reflects the status of your products to users based on how much of a product you have in stock.

How it works

Inventory is classified into one of the following categories based on availability and quantity in your local products inventory:


  In stock: Items that have quantities of 3 items or more.
  Limited stock: Items that have quantities of 2 items or less.
  On Display to Order (ODO): Items that are displayed in-store, but not immediately available for purchase: Such as large furniture items, or different sizes and colors of a display model.
  Out of stock: Items that are marked as quantity 0. We won’t serve local inventory ads for these items.


Note: Inventory is classified based on the lower value between your availability and quantity.
