This article provides an overview of different options on managing orders with Buy on Google.

How it works

Manage orders in Merchant Center

Once orders are placed by customers on Buy on Google, you can view and update them on the Orders page under "All Orders" in Merchant Center. Here are things to consider if you choose to manage your orders this way:


  Minimal technical resources required for set up
  Typically requires less time to start on the feature
  
    More manual data entry required on an ongoing basis
  



  Note: To receive alerts when new orders are placed, turn on order notifications.


Use order feeds

Use Order Feeds to receive, process, and update orders without needing to use the Orders API or manually manage orders in Merchant Center. Here are things to consider if you choose to use the Order Feeds:


  Scales well for large volumes of orders
  May require technical work to automate receiving, processing, and updating orders


Use the Orders API

Google's Orders API helps you automatically ingest and update orders using your own Order Management System. Here are things to consider if you choose to use the Orders API:


  More technical work required
  Orders statuses and refunds are automatically updated to Google through your own Order Management System (OMS)
