 YouTube Shopping policies

To ensure a safe and positive experience for customers, Google requires that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations in addition to free listing policies and store policies. It’s important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the country where your business operates, as well as any other places YouTube Shopping offers are shown. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may ban you from promoting or selling your products on our platforms.
