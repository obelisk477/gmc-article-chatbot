 About annotations and badges in Shopping ads and free listingsAnnotations and badges are additional information that may be displayed on the Shopping ads or free listings product cards. They help your product stand out and can help increase the performance of your offers.

Google dynamically decides which annotations and badges to display to optimize relevance to users and improve performance for merchants. Providing all the information doesn’t guarantee that the annotation will be displayed for your products. Some annotations are only displayed in specific devices such as mobile and desktop, or surfaces like Google Search and the Shopping tab, or countries. Annotations may be adjusted at any time.

This article covers annotations and badges displayed on Shopping ads and free listings. Additional information may be available in the product viewer, when users click on your product.
