 Mobile link [mobile_link] (Collections)

The mobile link [mobile_link] attribute lets you include a URL that links to a mobile-optimized version of your collection's landing page. This mobile version is the final landing page URL and will be shown to users on mobile devices, like phones or tablets.


When using this attribute, you’ll see additional reporting in Merchant Center for potential issues with your mobile-optimized landing pages. Creating a mobile-optimized site helps ensure that your collection appears correctly, and potentially loads faster, on mobile devices.

When to use


 Optional for each collection.


If you submit the mobile link [mobile_link] attribute in addition to the link [link] attribute, all mobile device users are directed to the landing page specified in the mobile link attribute.
