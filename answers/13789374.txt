 How to fix: Missing link template [link_template]Add the link template [link_template] attribute to your local products
One or more of your products is missing the link template [link_template] attribute. When using the merchant hosted local storefront (full), you must provide a link template [link_template] with the store code [store_code] ValueTrack attribute to all your local products. You can also add the optional mobile link for merchant hosted local storefront [mobile_link_template] attribute to deliver a merchant hosted local storefront that is optimized for mobile devices and to track mobile clicks.

Your link template must follow the landing page requirements for merchant hosted local storefront (full).


  Note: If you're already submitting the ads redirect [ads_redirect] attribute in your local products feed, you must include the store code [store_code] ValueTrack parameter for both the ads redirect [ads_redirect] attribute and the link for merchant hosted local storefront [link_template] attribute.
