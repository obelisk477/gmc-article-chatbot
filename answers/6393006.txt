 Add structured data attributes

This article lists all of the structured data attributes you can provide in your promotions feed.

Optional structured data fields are attributes that provide additional information about your promotion type (for example, 10% off and buy one, get one free). Structured data allows Google to display more detailed information about your shopping ad promotions to customers on mobile devices.

Note: All structured data attributes you submit must match information in your promotion's promotion title [long_title]. During the review process, Google validates your data. If information does not match the promotion title, Google will edit the structured fields to match the information in the promotion title. If you don't submit the structured data for your promotion, Google attempts to structure your promotion based on the promotion title.

The coupon value type structured attribute

When included in your promotions feed, this optional attribute signals the type of promotion benefit you’re offering, allowing Google to perform a more automated review process, which can expedite your promotion’s approval. Structured data also allows Google to display more detailed information about your Shopping ad promotions to customers on mobile devices.

When you use the optional coupon value type [coupon_value_type] attribute, this may require the use of additional attributes, depending on the value you submit. For example, if you want to submit the money off [money_off] attribute as the value for the coupon value type [coupon_value_type], you must also provide the monetary discount amount of a promotion [money_off_amount] attribute.

This article and the following table show which attributes are required or optional to include in your promotions feed depending on the value you submit for the coupon value type [coupon_value_type].


  Note: You can still submit structured data attributes without using the coupon value type attribute.
