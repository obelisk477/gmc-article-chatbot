 How to fix: Suspended storeRemove suspended stores from the offer

One or more store codes in your vehicle inventory ads data (which are submitted using the vehicle fulfillment store code [vehicle_fulfillment_store_code] or store code [store_code] attributes) is referencing a listing that has been identified as suspended within the linked location group of your Business Profile account. As a result, the offers associated with those store codes are not eligible to be shown in ads.

Follow these instructions to have your suspended listings reviewed.
