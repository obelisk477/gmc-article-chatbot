 Vehicle ads Content API guidelines

Overview

This article outlines Content API specifications and guidelines for vehicle ads.

When you have set up your Merchant Center account, you can upload your feeds using the Google Content API.


  Note: All vehicle ads campaigns will be upgraded to Performance Max by September 2023.



API specifications

Account management

There are several Content API endpoints that can be used in conjunction with Merchant Center advanced accounts:


  accounts.authinfo will return a list of accounts or sub-accounts of the current authenticated user.
  accounts.claimwebsite can be used to claim websites of Merchant Center sub-accounts.


For a full list of endpoints, refer to the Account REST Resource page.
