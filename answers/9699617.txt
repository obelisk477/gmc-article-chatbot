 Collections data specification

Collections offer a way to group your existing products and enrich them with creative data. A single collection can be used with multiple formats.


  Note: At this time Collections are only used by promotion of local products within Performance Max for store goals.


Use this product data specification to format your data for collections. Submit your data in the correct format, as this is important for successfully surfacing your collections on Google.

Note: The attributes documented here are specific to collections and differ from those in the Shopping product data specification.


  How to use

  
    You must submit collections data in Merchant Center (in addition to your existing product data). You can use Google Sheets, feed upload, or scheduled fetch to upload your collections product data. Content API is not yet supported for collections. You must provide your collections data using the required attributes, which are detailed in the table below. Before you upload your file to Merchant Center, you should convert it to a tab-delimited .txt file. Learn more about creating Tab-delimited data feeds

    When you create a collections feed in your Merchant Center account, you can choose the destinations where the collections in your feed may surface, similar to your product feeds.

    The Diagnostics page in your Merchant Center account provides collections issue reporting and includes an overview of issues to address. Learn more about Merchant Center diagnostics
  



Basic collections data



  
    
      Attribute
      Format
      Minimum requirements at a glance
    
    
      
      Featured product [featured_product]
      
      
       Required for promoting local products within Performance Max for store goals 

      This identifies one or more products that are associated with the collection. It is used as a lookup to the corresponding product ID in your product feeds.

      Example

      A2B4:0.5:0.25

      SKU15::

      Syntax

      The feature product [featured_product] attribute has 3 sub-attributes:

      
        ID [id] ( Required).
          Identification for your linked product
        X [x]: float [0-1] ( Required for or used in Performance Max for store goals).
          X-coordinate of the product callout in consumer experiences
        Y [y]: float [0-1] ( Required for or used in Performance Max for store goals).
          Y-coordinate of the product callout in consumer experiences
      

      Note: For the "promoting local products within Performance Max for store goals" format, you can provide random coordinates but the coordinate must be different for each featured product. For example, you can increment the coordinates by 1 for each featured product as shown below:

      
        Featured Product 1:0.01:0.01
        Featured Product 2:0.02:0.02
        Featured Product 3:0.03:0.03
      
      
      
      
        Use this attribute to list the featured products for this collection
        If you add this attribute, then the feed label [feed_label] attribute is required and the language [language] attribute is recommended. These attributes are used to uniquely identify the featured product by matching on the country and language of the products that you submitted
        Provide a maximum of 100 featured product [featured_product] attributes (for collections)
