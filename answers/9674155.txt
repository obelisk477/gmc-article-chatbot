 Product country [product_country] (Collections)


  
    Note: The product country [product_country] attribute has been deprecated and will soon be removed. For new and existing feeds, you can optionally use the feed label [feed_label] attribute (if you’re using feed labels for your product feeds in Merchant Center).
  



Use the product country [product_country] attribute to specify the country for the featured products linked to your collection. However, if you're using feed labels for your product feeds in Merchant Center, you should use the feed label [feed_label] attribute instead.

When to use


 Optional if you have featured products linked to your collection.


The product country [product_country] attribute can be used to match your collection to specific products in your existing Merchant Center product feeds. If you create new Merchant Center product feeds with feed labels, this matching may stop working for those feeds. Use the feed label [feed_label] instead.

Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your collections.


Minimum requirements

These are the requirements you need to meet to show your collection. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your collection and let you know in the Diagnostics page of your Merchant Center account.



  Submit only one value for the product country [product_country] attribute for each collection. To link products from multiple countries, create multiple collections, each with a different product country.
  Always specify product countries for collections that have featured products. This will allow us to determine the specific products associated with each collection.
  Ensure that the product country submitted is one of the CLDR country codes.



Best practices

These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your collection data for performance.



  If a collection includes featured products, the country of sale for those products must match the product country that is specified for the collection in order to be linked to the collection.
