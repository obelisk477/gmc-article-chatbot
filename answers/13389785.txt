All Discovery and Demand Gen product ads must comply with our advertising policies and our Shopping ads policies. This article outlines the additional requirements your products must meet to serve as a Discovery or Demand Gen product ad.

Discovery and Demand Gen Shopping campaigns combine audience targeting features and visually engaging formats to help you better personalize your ads within Google's feeds to inspire customer action. This article outlines the requirements Discovery and Demand Gen product ad assets (headline, description, or image) must meet for your Discovery and Demand Gen Shopping campaigns to serve.

Customers visit the YouTube Home and Watch Next feeds, Discover, and the Gmail Promotions and Social tabs to browse and explore new content that aligns with their interests. To ensure that we provide a high-quality consumer ad experience on Google’s personalized feeds, Discovery and Demand Gen product ads must comply with all Google Ads and personalization policies.

In addition, we'll review each Discovery and Demand Gen product ad asset for compliance with the Discovery and Demand Gen product ads requirements listed below, which will take priority in the event there's conflict with the Google Ads and personalization policies. Discovery and Demand Gen product ads requirements may be more restrictive than the ads requirements for other platforms and surfaces, meaning disapproved Discovery and Demand Gen product ad assets may continue to run on Google’s other properties.

Automated content policy decision

To ensure a good experience for the customer, we may conduct automated reviews of your campaign content. This preliminary review may trigger restriction or suspension of the assets. If necessary, Google may further analyze the assets for a final decision.
