 Improve eligible inventory

Eligible inventory is inventory thatâ€™s eligible to show in local inventory ads and free local product listings.

Google shows local inventory ads and listings for items that meet the requirements below:


  The store code corresponds with a published Business Profile in your linked business group.
  The ID [id] corresponds with a product in your primary feed that meets the feed attribute requirements and Shopping ads policies.
  The inventory item is in stock, or if your account is enabled for this feature, on display to order. Learn more about on display to order
