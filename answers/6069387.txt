Technical requirements
ID for display ads [display_ads_id] - An identifier for a product for dynamic remarketing campaigns


  This attribute will override the ID [id] attribute in your product feed for your dynamic remarketing campaigns only. The ID for display ads [display_ads_id] for each product has to be unique within your account, and cannot be re-used between feeds. If you have multiple feeds, the ID for display ads of products within different feeds must still be unique. You can use any sequence of letters and numbers for the ID for display ads attribute.

  When to include: Required if the product IDs for your dynamic remarketing campaigns are different from the ID [id] attribute you submit for Shopping ads and free product listings.

Title for display ads [display_ads_title] - Title of a product for dynamic remarketing campaigns


  This attribute will override the title [title] attribute for your dynamic remarketing campaigns only. We recommend you include characteristics in the title that differentiate the product from other products, such as color or brand.

  When to include: Recommended if the title you want to use for a product in your dynamic remarketing campaign is different from the title [title] attribute you submit for Shopping ads and free listings.
  
  		Content API v2 (JSON)
  		 "displayAdsTitle": "Mens Pique Polo Shirt"
  	
  	
  		Content API v2 (XML)
  		<display_ads_title>Mens Pique Polo Shirt</display_ads_title>
  	

  
    
      
        Type

        XML (Feeds)
        <g:display_ads_title>Mens Pique Polo Shirt</g:display_ads_title>
      
    
  

  Important:

  
    We recommend that you follow our Editorial guidelines closely if you're using title for display ads [display_ads_title]. For example, we recommend that you don't include any promotional text such as "Free shipping", and do not use BLOCK CAPITALS.
    For variant products, you are required to include the common title of the variant products. For example if “Mens Pique Polo Shirt” is available in red and blue colors, you can have one of the following titles:
      
        Men's Pique Polo Shirt (Can be used for both variants)
        Men's Pique Polo Shirt - Red (For the red shirt)
        Men's Pique Polo Shirt - Blue (For the blue shirt)
