 How to fix: Ungrouped variant based on matching value: link [link], image link [image_link], title [title]To group product variants together, use an additional value

If you submit two or more products with the same values for the link [link], image link [image_link], or title [title] attributes, but they don't share the same item group ID [item_group_id], it may create duplicate offers in your product data. This could be because you haven't submitted variant attributes such as size or color to indicate the difference between similar products, or because you submitted a generic value such as "0", for the title [title] attribute for multiple products. To ensure that we can correctly identify your products, provide a consistent item group ID [item_group_id] for similar products to organize them in a variant group, and add applicable variant attributes to differentiate them.

  Step 2: Add variant attributes

  
    
      Filter the downloaded report so that you only see products with:
        "Issue title" = Ungrouped variant based on matching value: image link [image_link] or
        "Issue title" = Ungrouped variant based on matching value: link [link] or
        "Issue title" = Ungrouped variant based on matching value: title [title]
      Search your product data for those products (using the ID). Make sure that you provide a consistent item group ID [item_group_id] for similar products, and add applicable variant attributes, such as size [size] or color [color] to differentiate them.
      Remove any duplicate products for which there are no variant attributes.
    
  

  
    Step 3: Resubmit your product data

    
      
  After you’ve updated your product data, resubmit it using one of these methods:
    
      Upload a feed
      Submit through the Content API
      Import content from an ecommerce platform
    
  
  Next, check that you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the Diagnostics page.
    
    Keep in mind: It may take some time for your change to be reflected on the Diagnostics page.
