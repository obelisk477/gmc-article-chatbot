 Store pickup error messagesTo let customers buy this product online and pick it up in a store, submit compatible values for these attributes

You must supply values for both the pickup method [pickup_method] attribute and the pickup SLA [pickup_sla] attribute. If you do not add both the pickup method [pickup_method] attribute and the pickup SLA [pickup_sla] attribute to your local products feed, you may receive the error messages below.


  
    Note: If an offer doesn't have either the pickup method [pickup_method] or the pickup SLA [pickup_sla] attribute, you won't receive any error messages because Google regards the offer as not eligible for store pickup.
