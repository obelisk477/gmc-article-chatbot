    What do I do if I need support with my third-party application?

    You can find answers for all Merchant Center actions in this Help Centre, otherwise, check your third-party application's support options for more help.
  



Link your accounts

You may work with a third-party platform to show, promote or sell your products across Google. Linking your account will associate your Merchant Center account with an account that you manage on a third-party platform. This allows us to provide better services to you and your linked platforms.


  It may be easier to initiate linking from your third-party application. Be sure to check out your options to decide what will work best for you. 



  
    
      
      Sign in to Merchant Center.
    
    
      
      From the business icon on the left menu, click the Apps tab.
    
    
      
      In the 'Third-party apps' section, click the Add third-party app button.
    
    
      
      Choose an app to link to your Merchant Center account, click Add and then follow the instructions.
    
    
      
      
      Check the 'Status' column to see if your accounts have been successfully linked. You'll see 'Connected' in this column if your account has been successfully linked.

      
        Note: Make sure that you manage your account links carefully and that you remove any links if a third-party partnership ends. If you don't remove the link, your data may still be available to that third party.
