 About dispute resolution and mediation for merchants

Google is committed to working with you to address concerns that may arise in your interactions with our platform and services.

If you’re a merchant using Merchant Center and have a complaint regarding any alleged non-compliance by Google with any obligations set forth in Regulation 2019/1150 of 20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services, contact Google here.

If you’re a merchant based in the EU or the UK, you may apply to resolve a dispute with Google arising in relation to the provision of our online intermediation services through mediation. You can find more details about the mediators we're willing to engage with and instructions on how to request mediation here. 

Except as required by applicable law, mediation is voluntary and neither you nor Google are obliged to settle disputes through mediation.
