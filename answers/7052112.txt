  Other requirements

  
    In addition to this product data specification, your product data must also meet the following requirements:

    
      Shopping ads policies
      Landing page requirements
      Tax rate data requirements
      Shipping rate data requirements
      Checkout requirements and best practices
      Currency and language requirements
    
  



  Formatting your product data

  
    Use English when submitting the names of attributes and the values for attributes that use supported values. For example, the condition [condition] attribute uses the supported values new, refurbished, and used, which must be submitted in English in order for the system to read them. 

    
      For all attributes that do not use supported values, but rather allow for free form text, such as the title [title] or description [description] attributes, be sure to use the same language for all attributes in a feed. Use an underscore when submitting an attribute name with multiple words (for example, image_link). Learn more about how to submit attributes and attribute values

        Submit this value if you set up account shipping settings for carrier-calculated rates.
        If you don't provide shipping dimension attributes while using carrier-calculated rates, Google won't be able to calculate rates based on the dimensional weight of the product. If that's the case, we'll just calculate the rates based on the value you provided in the shipping weight [shipping_weight] attribute.
        If you submit this attribute, submit all shipping dimension attributes:
          
            Shipping length [shipping_length]
            Shipping width [shipping_width]
            Shipping height [shipping_height]
          
        
        Use the same unit for all shipping dimension attributes that apply to a single product.
        Google doesn't automatically calculate additional shipping cost for oversized products. If your package would be considered large or oversized by your carrier, you should use the shipping [shipping] attribute to set shipping cost for an individual product.
