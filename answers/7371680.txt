 Matched inventory: product

Product information is required for every product in your local inventory. Each unique id in your local product inventory feed should match an id in your local products feed.

Benefits

We can serve local inventory ads and free listings for products in your local inventory that have product information. As a result, you get more opportunities to drive traffic to your store when a nearby customer is shopping for your products.

How to check for matched inventory

Verify that each unique id in your local product inventory feed is also present in your local product feed.
