 How to fix: Unverified storeRemove unverified stores from the offer

One or more store codes ([vehicle_fulfillment_store_code] or [store_code] attributes) in your vehicle inventory ads data is referencing an entry that has been identified as not verified within the linked location group of your Business Profile account. As a result, the offers associated with those store codes are not eligible to be shown in ads.

To verify a location, follow the verification instructions.

You may see one or several verification types depending on the kind of business entry you manage.
