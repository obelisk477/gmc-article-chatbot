  Manage promotions using Shopify

  
    Before connecting your Shopify promotions with your Merchant Center account, you’ll first need to ensure that you have downloaded the Google & YouTube app on Shopify. This allows your promotions to automatically sync with your Merchant Center account.

    Promotion types supported

    The following promotion types can be connected with Merchant Center:

    
      Discount codes: Fixed value or percentage discounts code on products and variants.
      Automatic discounts: Discounts that apply automatically at checkout and in the shopping cart. You can create automatic discounts for a percentage or a fixed amount.
    

    
      Note: US, CA, UK, AU, IN, FR, DE, ES, IT, NL, and JP promotions are eligible to be connected to your Merchant Center account. Automatic discounts of Shopify are eligible for integration into Merchant Center in the US currently.
    

    Promotion types not supported

    At this time, the following types of promotions and conditions can’t be connected to your Merchant Center account:

    
      Any free shipping promotions
      Buy X get Y promotions
      All types of discounts on collections in your store

          Only online discounts will be connected with Merchant Center

    Opt out specific Shopify promotions from showing on Google

    If you don’t want specific promotions to show on Google, you can opt out directly through your Shopify account. To manage your promotions, which are called “discounts” in Shopify, refer to the Shopify Help Center for next steps. Alternatively you can end those promotions in your Merchant Center account. Removing a specific promotion from your Merchant Center account won’t stop the promotion from appearing on your Shopify store. Once you have ended a promotion in the Merchant Center, it can't be restarted.

    
      Note: It may take a few hours after you end a promotion before it's removed.
    

    To end your promotions in Merchant Center:

    
      In your Merchant Center account, click Marketing in the navigation menu. You can also find the link to your Merchant Center account under the Google & YouTube app settings in your Shopify account.

        
          Note: You should log in to Merchant Center using the same Google account associated with your Shopify account.
        
      
      Click Promotions.
      Check the box next to the promotion you want to end.
      Click End promotions.
      (Optional) You can also end specific promotions from their description page. After you’ve clicked into the specific promotion, scroll to the bottom of the description page and select End Promotion.
