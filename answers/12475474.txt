 Setup issues


  If you’re looking for information about troubleshooting your account in the classic Merchant Center experience, click here. 



 

Before your products can be shown in ads and free listings, you need to complete the necessary steps to set up your Merchant Center, such as claiming your website and verifying your phone number. If you have not completed these steps, you’ll see a banner at the top of Merchant Center. 

Common issues

When you begin setting up your Merchant Center, you’re guided through the steps that are required for setup. You may complete some of these steps immediately and others later on. Here are a few common set up requirements:


  Add a valid phone number
  Add a business name that complies with Google’s policies
  Claim and verify your website
  Add product data to your account
  A landing page that matches your ad or free product listing
  Show a clear return and refund policy on your website


If you don’t complete these steps your ads and free listings may not show.

Where to find issues

Setup issues will show in the same places as other issues. You’ll see them in banners at the top of Merchant Center. You can also reference the summary cards on the “Needs attention” page.
