 About the store feed specification


  This feed is only used to implement the optional local feeds partnership program.



The store feed maps your store codes to store addresses. If you don't provide this feed, you must match the store codes in your sales and inventory feeds to the store codes in the retailer's Google Business Profiles. This feed must be uploaded when you add new retailers or stores to the program.
