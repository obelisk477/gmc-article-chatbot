 Local promotions feed specification

The information that you provide for local promotions is distributed in local ads on the Shopping tab, and displays on both desktop and mobile devices. This is done by uploading a local promotions feed containing information about the promotions that you use in stores. The information should be accurate and include all the attributes that you use to describe your local promotions.

A feed is an XML file, tab delimited file, or Google spreadsheet that is uploaded into Google Merchant Center, and can include multiple entries. Upload the local promotions feed to the same Merchant Center account that is used for your Google products feed (contact us to make sure the account is provisioned to participate in local promotions).

In this article, you'll learn about the attributes available for a local promotions feed. To see an example of a local promotions feed, select the button below.

  Keep in mind

  
    All promotions are reviewed against promotions program policies and editorial requirements.
    We recommend using structured data attributes for offers submitted using a promotions feed. Learn more about structured data attributes
    Shipping-related offers aren't accepted for local promotions.
    Providing a promotions feed doesn't affect any of your rankings on Google.

Required attributes
Promotion ID [promotion_id]


  This is the unique ID of a promotion. For in-store promotions that apply to specific products, the “promotion_id” values in your promotions feed should match the “promotion_id” values in your products feed. This will allow Google to identify to which products the promotion should be applied.

  Important:

  
    The promotion ID is case sensitive. If you're mapping a specific promotion to a set of products in your products feed, it must match exactly in both feeds.
    The promotion ID should not contain spaces or symbols (for example, %, !, etc.).
    To add multiple promotion ID values to an item (you can add up to 10 per item), submit them separated by commas in the “promotion id” column in your products feed.
    A promotion ID cannot be longer than 60 characters.
  

Products eligible for promotion [product_applicability]


  This indicates whether the promotion is applicable to all products or only specific products.

  Valid values:

  
    All products [all_products]
    Specific products [specific_products]
  

  Important:

  
    If the value is set to specific_products, then product targeting attributes will be used to determine to which products the promotion applies (see Optional attributes below to learn about product targeting).
    If the value is set to all_products, then product targeting filters will be ignored.
  

Coupon code required [offer_type]


  This attribute indicates whether or not you require online shoppers to use a code in order to redeem the offer.

  Valid values:

  
    No code [no_code]
    Generic code [generic_code]
  

  
    Note: If the coupon code required [offer_type] is generic_code (that is, a code that is the same for all shoppers), the generic redemption code [generic_redemption_code] attribute is also required.
  

Generic redemption code [generic_redemption_code]


  This attribute specifies the code (example: EXTRA20) that shoppers will use online to redeem the promotion.

  Important:

  
    It is required if the coupon code required [offer_type] attribute is set to generic_code.
    The value submitted for the generic redemption code [generic_redemption_code] attribute should not exceed 20 characters.
  

Promotion title [long_title]


  This is the full title of the promotion. These editorial requirements describe title guidelines and formatting, and also provide examples of what is and isn’t acceptable.
  

  Important:
  

  
    The promotion title [long_title] should describe the promotion completely and accurately.
    It should not exceed 60 characters.
  

Promotion start date [promotion_effective_dates]


  This attribute indicates the dates and time frame when the promotion is active. Syntax:

  
    Date format: YYYY-MM-DD
    Time format: HH:MM:SS, not including the adjustment relevant to GMT (see below).
      
        Times are based on GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). Therefore, you also have to include the number of hours and minutes (+HH:MM or -HH:MM) your time differs from GMT, immediately afterwards.
          
            For example, if your promotion time is in PST (Pacific Standard Time), you would add “-08:00” since PST is 8 hours earlier than GMT.
          
        
      
    
    Dates and times should be separated by the letter “T”.
    List the start date + time first, followed by the end date + time, separating them by a forward slash (/).
  

  Examples:

  
    If your promotion was valid from 3:00 a.m. on July 19th, 2019 to 9:00 p.m. on July 26th, 2019 EST (Eastern Standard Time) you would submit:
      
        2019-07-19T03:00:00-05:00/2019-07-26T21:00:00-05:00
      
    
    If your promotion was valid from 3:00 a.m. on July 19th, 2019 to 9:00 p.m. on July 26th, 2019 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) you would submit:
      
        2019-07-19T03:00:00+00:00/2019-07-26T21:00:00+00:00
      
    
  

  Important:

  
    Remember to adjust for Daylight Savings when applicable:
      
        In Standard time, “-05:00” represents EST while “-08:00” represents PST.
        During Daylight Savings, “-04:00” represents EDT while “-07:00” represents PDT.

    If this value is left empty, your promotion will default to online.

Optional attributes

Product targeting attributes
