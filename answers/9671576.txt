 How to fix: Deactivated Business Profile

One or more store codes in your local inventory data is referencing a Business Profile that has been identified as deactivated within the linked business group.

Fix your issue


  Step 1 of 2: Add the store codes to the inventory feed 

  
    
      
        Review the guidelines to represent your business on Google.
        Sign in to manage your Business Profile. Ensure your profile follows the guidelines.
        After your profile meets guidelines, you can ask for reinstatement.
      
    
  



  Step 2 of 2: Resubmit your product data

  
    
      
        After reinstating your Business Profile, resubmit your inventory feed using one of these methods:
          
            Upload a feed
            Submit through the Content API
          
        
        Next, check if you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the processing report.
      

      
        Note: It can take up to 24 hours to sync your business locations into your Merchant Center account, so we recommend that you upload your inventory feed 24 hours after linking accounts, or after a store code is updated in your Business Profile.
