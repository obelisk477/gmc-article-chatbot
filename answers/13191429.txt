 How to Fix: Missing New Vehicle’s Price (OEMs only)

You’ve uploaded an automobile offer for which the condition [condition] attribute is set to “new”, but you have not included a valid value for either the required all-in price [vehicle_all_in_price] attribute or the MSRP [vehicle_msrp] attribute.

As a result, your offer will not function properly.

This issue can be fixed by re-uploading your offer with the missing information.
