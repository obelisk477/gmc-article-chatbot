 Checkout and landing page requirements to show users free and fast annotation on your ads

To be eligible to show the free and fast shipping annotation on your Shopping ads, Buy on Google listings, and free product listings, you'll need to meet certain checkout and landing page requirements. These are in place to ensure a consistent user experience.

Requirements


  
    Checkout: You must provide users with at least one shipping option that explicitly shows delivery within 3 business days at no shipping cost. The delivery time shouldn’t exceed the figures you submit to Merchant Center.

    Landing page: For eligible products, product landing pages must not have shipping information inconsistent with free and fast shipping.
  


Example checkout shipping scenarios


  
    
      Note: The examples here aren't exhaustive. We've included some alternative phrasing possibilities, but they may not cover your shipping options exactly. The most important thing to remember is that your shipping configuration must offer delivery in 3 business days or fewer at no shipping cost - inclusive of processing and handling time.

Example landing page shipping scenarios


  
    
      Note: Your landing page shipping information must not contradict your checkout shipping speed and the information in your Shopping ad or free listing. In other words, if you've shown the free and fast shipping annotation on your ads or free listings, your landing page must not say anything about shipping that costs money or that takes longer than 3 days (but it can also say nothing).
