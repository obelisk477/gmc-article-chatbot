 How to fix: Missing valid ship-to-store store codeAdd a valid store code for the ship-to-store fulfillment of the local vehicle offer in your product feed

No valid store code has been provided in your product feed for your ship-to-store vehicle ad. As a result, the ship-to-store fulfillment option won't be considered for this offer when ads are shown.

In addition to providing the vehicle fulfillment [vehicle_fulfillment] attribute with the option [option] sub-attribute set to ship_to_store, local vehicle offers require that you provide a store code using the store code [store_code] sub-attribute. The store code you submit must match one of the dealershipâ€™s existing codes you have provided in your Business Profile.
