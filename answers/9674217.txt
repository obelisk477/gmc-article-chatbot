 Custom label 0-4 [custom_label_0-4] (Collections)

Custom labels allow you to create specific filters to use in your collections. Use these filters for reporting and bidding on groups of collections. The information you include in this attribute won’t be shown to customers.

For example, you could label a group of collections as "kitchens", "sneakers", or "summer collection".


Note that the custom label 0-4 [custom_label_0-4] attribute for Collections is different from the custom label 0-4 [custom_label_0-4] attribute used in Shopping ads and free product listings, but it works in the same way.

Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to make sure you submit high-quality data for your collections.


Minimum requirements

These are the requirements you need to meet to show your collection. If you don't follow these requirements, we'll disapprove your collection and let you know in the Diagnostics page of your Merchant Center account.



  
    Submit only 1 value for each custom label 0-4 [custom_label_0-4] attribute.
  
  Create up to 1,000 unique labels for each custom label 0-4 [custom_label_0-4] attribute across your account (up to 5,000 labels total, 1,000 values per attribute). If you submit collections with a custom label after you exceed the limit, you won’t see reporting on collections with those additional labels. You might also see other reporting errors. To fix the issue, reduce the number of unique labels, and then resubmit your collections’ data.



Best practices

These best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your collection data for performance.



  Create up to five custom labels for each collection: Custom label 0 [custom_label_0] through custom label 4 [custom_label_4]
  Choose your own definition for each of the five custom labels.
