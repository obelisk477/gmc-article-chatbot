 About product data alerts

Product data alerts are email notifications you'll receive when something unexpected happens with your product data, such as when the number of active items drops significantly for a certain set of products.

This article explains how product data alerts work and how they're triggered.

Benefits

You can review any issues with your product data in your Merchant Center, but there might be a considerable lag between the time an error occurs and the time you check back. Product data alerts allow Google to notify you by email as soon as a problem with your eligible products is detected.

How it works

By default, an alert will be triggered if a significant drop in active products is detected for any combination of target country and Google surface (for example, US + Shopping ads). The email will explain what happened and provide you with links to the relevant section of Merchant Center so that you can instantly check on your product data.


  Note: Any significant drops will cause an alert, even if they might've been intentional. A change in item status from "active" to "expiring" may also cause an alert. This status change occurs 3 days before an item expires.


Other types of product data alerts, such as product protection, are opt-in only and must be turned on before you can begin receiving notifications.

You can opt in or out of these alerts by changing your email preferences. Learn how to Change your Merchant Center email preferences.

  Note: Multi-client accounts may opt in to product data alerts at the top-level account. Sub-accounts don't have the option for product data alerts at this time.
