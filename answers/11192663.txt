 Vehicle ads onboarding guideCreate a primary feedNext: Register and submit your feed


   This is step 4a of the vehicle ads onboarding guide.


This article describes how to upload a primary feed to enable vehicle ads.

If you're interested in submitting vehicle ads data through API, click here.

The primary feed is a list of all your vehicle inventory with descriptive attributes. Some attributes are required for all vehicle ads in your feed, some are required for certain types of vehicle ads, and other attributes are recommended.


  
    Notes:

    
      Not providing a required attribute may prevent that particular vehicle ad from showing up in results.
      Not providing recommended attributes may impact the ad's performance.
    
  


Google recommends submitting all your vehicle inventory in a single feed.

Before you begin


  Supported Vehicle Types: Only non-commercial, passenger vehicles such as cars and pickup trucks (utes in AU) are supported. Vehicle ads can't be used to promote RVs, boats, buses, trains, etc.
  Supported Offers: Your feed should only include vehicle offers. It shouldn't include offers for spare parts, accessories, or any other shopping offers.
  Attribute headers: You must use the exact attribute headers listed below for your feed to be processed correctly.
  Unique Vehicle Offers: Ensure that you submit each vehicle offer only once in the feed by checking the vehicle identification number (VIN). If the same vehicle is available for multiple store codes or has multiple fulfillment types, these are supported by repeated fields for store codes and the group attribute for vehicle fulfillment, and there is no need to submit a VIN multiple times for these scenarios. If a VIN is submitted for more than one vehicle offer, those offers will be disapproved in the feed.
    
      Exception: If you’re submitting offers in multiple languages, the VIN can be submitted once for each language (if available).
    
  



  Note: All vehicle ads campaigns will be upgraded to Performance Max by September 2023.



Build your primary feed

Step 1: Create a delimited text file, an XML file, or use API

To start, create either a delimited text file (recommended) or an XML file, or use the API.

Step 2: Tell us about the vehicles in your inventory

Your primary feed is Google’s source of information for your vehicle ads. The information you submit in this feed is what appears to auto shoppers searching for your products.

      Text feeds

      Format the group attribute name using vehicle_fulfillment, and then in parentheses, adding one of the supported fulfillment values followed by store_code (as needed). The store_code sub-attribute needs to be repeated for each store code value you want to submit, separated by a colon ( : ).

      Example: In store fulfillment

      If the store_code sub-attribute is repeated in the group attribute name, but only one store code value is submitted, the entry will still be accepted since there is only one colon in the value.

      When a colon (:) doesn't indicate a separate sub-attribute value, the value should be surrounded by quotes (").

      
        
          
            Name
            vehicle_fulfillment(option:store_code:store_code)
          
          
            Values
            in_store:1111:2222
            in_store:1111
            in_store:1111:”2222:2”
          
        
      

      Example: Online fulfillment

      The store_code sub-attribute isn't required for online offers.

      
        
          
            Name
            vehicle_fulfillment(option)
          
          
            Value
            online
          
        
      

      Example 3 : Hybrid offer

      A hybrid offer combines both of the above examples as separate columns in the data

      
        
          
            
            {other feed cols}
            
            vehicle_fulfillment(option)
            vehicle_fulfillment
            (option:store_code:store_code)
          
          
            …
            online
            in_store:1111:2222
          
        
      

      Google Sheets

      Format the group attribute name the same way as with text feeds. When a colon (:) isn't used to separate sub-attribute values, it should be submitted with a preceding backslash ( “ \ “ )

      
        
          
            Name
            vehicle_fulfillment(option:store_code:store_code)
          
          
            Values
            in_store:1111:2222
            in_store:1111
            in_store:1111:2222\:2
          
        
      

      XML Feeds

      Include the store_code sub-attribute as needed. To specify different fulfillment options, submit multiple vehicle_fulfillment attributes and include the store_code sub-attribute.

      Example

      <g:vehicle_fulfillment>
        <g:option>online</g:option>
        </g:vehicle_fulfillment>
        <g:vehicle_fulfillment>
        <g:option>in_store</g:option>
        <g:store_code>1111</g:store_code>
        <g:store_code>2222</g:store_code>
        </g:vehicle_fulfillment>

  Note:

  
    Vehicle ads don’t have availability [availability] as an attribute. Therefore, don’t submit this attribute. Submitting it may lead to errors in the feed.
    If you don’t submit a value for an optional attribute, Google interprets it as though that attribute hasn’t been submitted.
  


More frequent inventory updates

Inventory price and availability can change frequently. Increase the feed frequency to carry out more frequent updates of your inventory data. To submit product data through API, learn more about the Google Content API.
