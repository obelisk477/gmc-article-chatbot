Ad campaigns can help you boost sales by reaching customers from more places across Google. Creating a campaign in Google Merchant Center will advertise your products across Google Ads channels like YouTube, Search, and Discover.

Your ads can show rich product information like images, prices, and store names. They’re created using data attributes from the product information in your Merchant Center feed and are shown to people who are already searching for the kinds of products you advertise.

How it works


  We use your existing Merchant Center product data to decide how and where to show your ads.
  The product data you submit in Merchant Center contains details about the products you sell. We use these details when we match a user's search to your ads, making sure to show the most relevant products. All available products in Merchant Center will be advertised in your campaigns by default.
  Potential customers will discover ads for your products on Google’s channels (for example, while they’re searching for a video on YouTube). Based on information in your feed, customers will view things like a photo of the product, title, price, store name, and other important information in the ad.
  Customers click on your ads to learn more about your products before making a purchase. You pay per click.
