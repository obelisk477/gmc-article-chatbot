 Merchant hosted local storefront (full) setup errors

This page explains various reasons why merchant hosted local storefront (full) setups are rejected by Google and what steps can be taken to resolve the issues.

Ensure that your product pages can display price and availability based on a Business Profile store code

The merchant hosted local storefront full feature requires that local inventory ad clicks redirect to a landing page which displays a product’s store-specific price and store-specific availability based on a Business Profile store code. This is done by replacing the store code [store_code] ValueTrack parameter from the link for your merchant hosted local storefront (full) [link_template] with a Business Profile store code when an ad is clicked. Follow the steps below:

Example: store_code as URL parameter


  
    
      
      itemid
      
      
      title
      
      Ads redirect [ads_redirect]
      [link_template]

      {store_code}&trackingParameter=value
      
      
      http://mikemart.com/123?store={store_code}
      
    
  


 


  
    
      itemid
      price
      quantity
      [store_code]
    
    
      123
      249.99 USD
      5
      101
    
  


 

The resulting landing page for item 123 at store code 101 is http://mikemart.com/123?store=101

  Step 2: Confirm that your example product landing page URL directs you to a store-specific landing page

  
    
      Your landing page shouldn’t return a 404 error. If you receive a 404 error, you’ll need to work with your website teams to determine if your website can support store-specific information based on a Business Profile store code.

        Sign in to your Merchant Center account.
