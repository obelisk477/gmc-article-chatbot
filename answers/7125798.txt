Copyright

Google Customer Reviews doesn't allow the copying or distribution of copyrighted material unless you have consent from the copyright holder, or are otherwise permitted by law.

To send us proof that you have the necessary rights to the copyrighted material, please fill out our copyright documentation form.

To learn more about how we handle copyright issues within Google or to submit a copyright-related complaint, please view the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and our copyright policy and procedures.

Examples of prohibited content include unauthorized or "bootleg" copies of media, software, or other licensed or protected material. Mod chips or other devices designed to circumvent copyright protection are also prohibited.

Counterfeit

Google Customer Reviews doesnâ€™t allow the promotion of counterfeit goods. Counterfeit goods contain a trademark or logo that is identical to or substantially indistinguishable from the trademark of another and mimic the brand features of the product in an attempt to pass themselves off as a genuine product of the brand owner.

Examples of prohibited content include replica, imitation, knock-off or other non-genuine product copying brand features in an attempt to pass itself off as a genuine product.
