 How to fix: Missing attribute value for grouped variantsSubmit this value for all product variants in the same group

You’ve submitted multiple products that use the same item group ID [item_group_id], but don’t consistently include the same variant attributes. Variant attributes help to differentiate products that are similar, but vary by distinct features, such as size [size], color [color], condition [condition], or gender [gender]. To ensure that we can correctly identify your products, either provide the same set of variant attributes for all products that use the same item group ID [item_group_id], or do not provide the item group ID [item_group_id] for these products.

Instructions


  Step 1: See the affected products

  
    
  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.
  Select Products on the navigation menu, then click Diagnostics.
  Click the Item issues tab to see current issues affecting your products.

  Step 2: Add variant attributes

  
    
      Filter the downloaded report so that you only see products with:
        "Issue title" = Missing attribute value for grouped variants
      Search your product data for those products (using the ID). Make sure that for each product that uses this value for the item group ID [item_group_id] attribute, you have also submitted a unique value for a variant attribute, such as size [size] or color [color].
      Remove any duplicate offers for which there are no variant attributes.
    
  

  
    Step 3: Resubmit your product data

    
      
  After you’ve updated your product data, resubmit it using one of these methods:
    
      Upload a feed
      Submit through the Content API
      Import content from an ecommerce platform
    
  
  Next, check that you’ve fixed the issue by making sure it’s no longer listed on the Diagnostics page.
    
    Keep in mind: It may take some time for your change to be reflected on the Diagnostics page.
