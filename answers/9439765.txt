 How to implement pickup later for local inventory ads

Pickup later allows you to provide a direct online to offline experience for your customers. For items that can be picked up in store within a specific SLA regardless of store availability, pickup later allows you to use your stores as an omnichannel asset and differentiator. Unlike other local inventory ads features, pickup later doesn't require full inventory information.

Pickup later for local inventory ads gives you full flexibility for granular SLA information at the store level for each product. Additionally, pickup later for local inventory ads is compatible with all of the other local inventory ads products: you can advertise pickup later alongside in-stock inventory in a way that maximizes the value of your stores as omnichannel assets.

Pickup later for local inventory ads runs in conjunction with Shopping ads, only surfacing when customers are more likely to engage with pickup later than alternatives based on user intent.

  Important: The Google-hosted local storefront can't be used in combination with pickup later for local inventory ads.



  Website requirements

  
    
      Display your pickup later option on your landing pages or in your checkout flow.
      Allow customers to select the store where their order will be shipped.
        
          Stores can be displayed after clicking on a link (for example: “check availability” or by entering a postal code or address).
          Alternatively, store selection can occur in your checkout flow after a customer has added an item to their cart.
        
      
      Display the item’s price on your product page.
        
          Note: The price must match the value of the price [price] attribute in your primary feed or local inventory feed. Submit the price [price] attribute in your primary feed for national default pricing and in the local product inventory feed for any store-specific overrides.
        
      
      Indicate pickup date and pickup fee (if a pickup fee will be charged).
        
          This may be displayed in your checkout flow alongside store selection.
        
      
      Provide an option to select other store locations.
        
          This may be displayed in your checkout flow alongside store selection.
        
      
      Allow users to complete and pay for their order on your website.
      Provide a pickup confirmation message when the order is ready (for example: email or SMS).
      Don't require customers to enter payment information before showing your fulfillment options.
    
  

  
    Website recommendations

    
      In addition to the website requirements above, we recommend the following:

      
        Don't require customers to create an account before showing your fulfillment options (for example: provide a “checkout as guest” option).
        Don't require customers to enter address information before showing your fulfillment options.
      
    
  


Feed requirements


  
    
      Important: Pickup later for local inventory ads allows you to advertise offers where availability is “out of stock” or the quantity is “0” (out of stock). Inventory offers with availability [availability] “in stock” or “limited availability” or quantity [quantity] larger than “0” will be treated as regular inventory ads.
    
  

  
    Pickup later enables you to create ads showing your local products regardless of whether the product is in the store when the order is placed. In order to create ads showing your local products for your in-stock items, you must verify your store inventory. Learn more About inventory verification
  

  In addition to the feed requirements for the merchant hosted feature, please add the following attributes to the assigned feeds below. Select the type of merchant hosted local storefront (MHLSF) you're using to ensure that you submit the correct values. If you're new to local inventory ads, we recommend that you use merchant hosted local storefront (basic). Learn more About the merchant hosted local storefront

        Best practices

        
          
            You may show the pickup later option in ads showing your local products if an item is out of stock at a local store, but can be shipped to the local store for a customer to pick up.

            
              Set the following attribute values in your local products inventory feed:
                
                  Availability [availability]: “out_of_stock”
                  Pickup method [pickup_method]: “ship_to_store”
                  Pickup SLA [pickup_sla]: choose one of the following values: "2-day", "3-day", "4-day", "5-day", "6-day", "multi-week"
                  If you were previously activated for pickup later for Shopping Ads and would now like to migrate to pickup later for local inventory ads also submit: Availability [availability]: “out of stock”
                
              
            

            
              Note: You may only select one omnichannel fulfillment option for each item in your inventory feed. Inserting 2 rows for the same item at the same store will cause an error.
            

            Implement both the pickup later feature and the pickup today feature to show your full range of fulfillment options to customers. Please review the pickup today implementation options.
