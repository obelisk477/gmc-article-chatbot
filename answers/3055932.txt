 About data mapping across feeds and accounts

In order to show customers which local products can be found in nearby stores, Google matches data across different sources: Business Profiles, the primary feed, and the local product inventory feed in Merchant Center.



About matching

The key links between all of your data submissions are your product identifiers and your store codes. These attributes must be consistent across all of your data sources.

As a starting point, we grab the unique ID for a product that matches a customerâ€™s search query.

Using the product ID, we match product information from the primary feed with the inventory information from the local product inventory feed. Then, we use your store code [store code] attribute from the local product inventory feed and match it against the Business Profiles from the linked business group to gather information about the store where that product is sold.
